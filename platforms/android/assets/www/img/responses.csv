In previous hackathon, HackFSU, I have created a remote buddy Android application that detects users location and send automatic messages to user's closest contacts. By allowing the user to preset the messages sent to the contacts and the frequency to which messages/locations are sent, user of the app can feel more secure and safe when traveling to unknown places. At the end poster session of the hackathon, I received positive feedbacks regarding how the safety is a critical issue in the society today. In HackNC, I hope to address the similar societal issues like health/medical. 
In addition, I am currently interning at a tech company as an Android development intern. For my internship, I am to create an Android app under 8 weeks time frame with two other interns and software engineer. This experience will solidify my skills of developing an app under time constraints. 
All projects and apps that I have made are on my Github page.",1,1,1,1,0,0,1,,,"Second year","Computer Science","2015-07-05 21:42:49","2015-07-05 21:50:17",09ae27fe18

Alongside a team of 3 other like-minded students, I would like to start an algorithm that determines genes responsible for a person's susceptibility to mental illness. While I have researched this topic before and understand that such an algorithm takes more time to develop, piecing the fundamental ""bare bones"" together while learning hands-on skills working with a team would be unparalleled. My team members are all interested in some field of BME and bioinformatics, so having like-minded perspectives and allowing each person to contribute to the table makes the hackathon process unique. I would also like to synthesize our minds to develop some product that would be useful for a future start-up development, mainly one used in healthcare that supports the health of developers and reduces physical strains on them while sitting at the desktop all day.

Hackathons don't allow for making revolutionary changes like reducing poverty, reforming politics or improving education.

For the past 2 summers I worked at a boy scout summer camp and I've always wanted to map out each individual tent there, Unfortinately, I need an exteremely accurate GPS equipment to do this, so right now I'm limited to just doing rough trails and outlines. Currently I'm working on outline the campsites.

Along with this, I would like to map out the whole camp using a 360 camera, which would allow you to use a VR headset or just a computer to explore all the trails and campsites.



I've started creating a map of our council here: http://tinyurl.com/lhcbsamap. The dot in the middle(Camp Crooked Creek) is the camp I've been talking about. If you zoom in on it, you can actually see the ""Seven Arrows Trail"", but Google has disabled mapmaker, so I can't add anything else yet.

I'm hoping not only to learn more technical areas (ie. languages, API's), but also to learn how to develop actual products. A lot of the programming I have done and projects I have worked on were always left incomplete - the idea was great, but as soon as things went from idea to actual code, team members would drop out, time would run out, funding would go away. With my first hackathon, I hope that the time constraint, as well as working with people who are just as dedicated as I am, will result in the true foundation of an actual product, and that  I will learn how to actually develop not just code. I'm also hoping to learn how quickly I can pick things up; I've always assumed I was a fast learner, but hacknc is a completely different ball-game, and I hope to see how quickly I can learn a new language, API, or style of programming.",1,1,1,0,,1,1,,,"First year","Political Science","2015-08-06 05:54:03","2015-08-06 06:09:01",19bd90ff28

Most importantly, I also see myself making an app in near future that can handle large volumes of text related with a specialty field. While working with Linguavista, I realized that there are hundreds of businesses around the world that are in need of fast, accurate and unique translations. For example, some of the leading Forex brokers operate in as many as 30 languages, powered by daily human translation, which costs a lot of time and money. We will be able to subdue the huge operating costs if we are able to develop an interactive solution.
